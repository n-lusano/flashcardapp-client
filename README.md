### About

FlashcardApp is an app to provide language learners with an essential learning tool. Flashcards help in building and expanding vocabulary in a fun way, which has long been regarded as the fastest and best way to memorize any type of information, and especially long lists, as it gets organized it in a way that fundamentally helps a more efficient learning strategy.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Goals

My goal for this project was to build a full stack app using the technologies learned in the bootcamp, together with what motivates me in my daily life as a language enthusiast and an expat who has been actively exercising multiple foreign languages for several years. Being a language learner myself personally motivated me in devising my own app in which collecting and rearranging all the features I was more intrigued by as a user, leaving others behind for a personally more fulfilling experience.

### Technologies

##### Front End

- Node.js
- React
- Redux
- Axios
- React Bootstrap

##### Back End

- Express
- REST
- Sequelize
- Postgres

### Project User Stories and Wireframe

The [user stories](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-client/projects/1) and [wireframe](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-client/blob/development/WIREFRAME.png) I used to plan my project.

### Server Repository

The repository for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-server). This is a RESTful API using Express.js. The database is built using Postgres. [Here](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-server/blob/development/DATABASE_MODEL.png) is the data model. Object-relational mapping is done using Sequelize.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

###### `npm install`

Installs all necessary dependencies to run the project.

###### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

###### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

###### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

###### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
