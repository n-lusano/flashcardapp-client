### About

FlashcardApp is an app to provide language learners with an essential learning tool. Flashcards help in building and expanding vocabulary in a fun way, which has long been regarded as the fastest and best way to memorize any type of information, and especially long lists, as it gets organized it in a way that fundamentally helps a more efficient learning strategy.

### Goals

My goal for this project was to build a full stack app using the technologies learned in the bootcamp, together with what motivates me in my daily life as a language enthusiast and an expat who has been actively exercising multiple foreign languages for several years. Being a language learner myself personally motivated me in devising my own app in which collecting and rearranging all the features I was more intrigued by as a user, leaving others behind for a personally more fulfilling experience.

The repository for the [backend](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-server) and the [data model](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-server/blob/development/DATABASE_MODEL.png) I used to plan my project.
