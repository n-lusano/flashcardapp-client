### About

FlashcardApp is an app to provide language learners with an essential learning tool. Flashcards help in building and expanding vocabulary in a fun way, which has long been regarded as the fastest and best way to memorize any type of information, and especially long lists, as it gets organized it in a way that fundamentally helps a more efficient learning strategy.

_This project is work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented or revised. Any suggestions or feedback is welcome! Feel free to contact me at n.lusano@gmail.com_ :v:

### Demo

### Goals

My goal for this project was to build a full stack app using the technologies learned in the bootcamp, together with what motivates me in my daily life as a language enthusiast and an expat who has been actively exercising multiple foreign languages for several years. Being a language learner myself personally motivated me in devising my own app in which collecting and rearranging all the features I was more intrigued by as a user, leaving others behind for a personally more fulfilling experience.

### Technologies

- Node.js
- React
- Redux
- Axios
- React Bootstrap

### Project User Stories and Wireframe

The [user stories](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-client/projects/1) and [wireframe](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-client/blob/master/WIREFRAME.png) I used to plan my project.

### Server Repository

The repository for the [backend](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-server) and the [data model](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-server/blob/master/DATABASE_MODEL.png) I used to plan my project. This is a RESTful API using Express.js. The database is built using Postgres. Object-relational mapping is done using Sequelize.

### Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Please refer to the [CRA_DOCS](https://github.com/n-lusano/flashcardapp-client/blob/master/CRA_DOCS.md).
